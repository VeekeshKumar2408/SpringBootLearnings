    /*
      1. Spring Framework contains multiple Spring Modules:

         a. Fundamental Features: Core (IOC Container, Dependency Injection, AutoWiring..)
         b. Web: Spring MVC etc (Web applications, REST API)
         c. Web Reactive: Spring WebFux etc.
         d. Data Access: JDBC, JPA etc.
         f. Integration: JMS etc,
         g. Testing: Mock Objects, Spring MVC Test etc.

      2. Application architectures evolve continuously.
         web>REST API>Microservices>Cloud>...

      3. Spring evolves through Spring projects:

         a. First Project: Spring Framework.
         b. Spring Security: Secure your web application or REST API or microservices.
         c. Spring Data: Integrate the same way with different type of databases: NoSql and Relational.
         d. Spring Integration: Address challenges with integration with other applications.
         e. Spring Boot: Popular framework to build microservices.
         f. Spring Cloud: Build cloud native applications.

      4. Hierarchy: Spring Projects> Spring Framework> Spring Modules.

      5. Why is Spring Eco System popular?

         a. Loose Coupling: Spring manages creation and wiring of beans and dependencies.
            Makes it easy to build loosely coupled applications.
            Makes writing unit testing easy!(Spring uit testing).

         b. Reduced boilerplate code: Focus only on business logic.
            example: no need for exception handling in each method.

         c. Architectural Flexibility: you can pick and choose which one to use.

         d. Evolution with time: Microservices and cloud.
